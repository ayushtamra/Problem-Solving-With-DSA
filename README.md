# Problem Solving with DSA ðŸš€

Welcome to my problem solving journeyâœ¨
The problems solved here have a large number of approaches, are well documented and refined to make reader learn through problems.


## Why I started this? ðŸ¤”

ðŸ”¥ Reading and understanding code of others is a really an underreated skill and many software engineering fields involve a great deal of understanding the code rarther than making huge code changes.

ðŸ”¥ Geeks for geeks, tutorials points are some great platforms where you can learn programming, but learning through different approaches with more code documentation is >>>


## Code template used

In most of the questions I have used a CPP code template which is competitive programming friendly and easy to undesrtand, it is very efficient in CP contests.

Template Link: [myC++Template.cpp](./myC%2B%2BTemplate.cpp)

Though there are many good templates for Competitive programming but at the very beginning you can practice with this!
