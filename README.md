### Description

Welcome to my problem solving journey✨
The problems solved here have a large number of approaches, are well documented and refined to make reader learn through problems.


### Why I started this?

1. Reading and understanding code of others is a really an underreated skill and many software engineering fields involve a great deal of understanding the code rarther than making huge code changes.

2. Geeks for geeks, tutorials points are some great platforms where you can learn programming, but learning through different approaches with more code documentation is >>>


### Code template used

In most of the questions I have used a CPP code template which is competitive programming friendly and easy to undesrtand, it is very efficient in CP contests.

> Template Link: [myC++Template.md](./myC%2B%2BTemplate.md)

Though there are many good templates for Competitive programming but at the very beginning you can practice with this!
