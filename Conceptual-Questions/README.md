## Conceptual questions

These conceptual questions are basic but are building blocks to solve a large problem efficiently.

Example: The very first problem is to count the frequency of each number in a vector. There can be two approches:

1. Frequency of each number through an internal loop followed by an external loop for traversing all elements in the vector.

Time complexity: O(N^2)

2. Through hashmaps, we can map each element with their count, and increment that count through traversal.

Time complexity: O(N)

Now this type of question can be a subpart/building-block of a hard problem, hence knowing approaches could be very benificial
